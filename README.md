midterm spin up script

This script is the midterm for my web applications class at Bellingham Technical College.The start up script’s not necessary as it only installs azure cli and updates the machine your working on.If you are using a fresh vm it will be easier to run this than copying the commands off the website one by one.I am using azure cloud 9 so I don’t need it or to add in the az login at the beginning as that is all done for me.

So far the issues I am running into are that for some reason when I create or pull a key in cli and add it to a variablethe formatting (I am assuming here) is getting jacked up and kicking an error. Might have something to do with the cloud 9 maybe?
